    "### Dataset Sourcing\n",
    "As indicated in the assignment description, I used the [Open Government Portal](https://search.open.canada.ca/opendata/) with filters `Open Data`, `Open Maps`, `Datatset`, `GeoTif`, and `Tif`. The search gave me over 300 results, from which I chose [Annual Crop Inventory](https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/ba2645d5-4458-414d-b196-6303ac06c1c9). This data is punlished annually in GeoTif format, with a spatial resolution of 30m pixels, subdivided at provincial boundaries. My variables of interest are _time_, _crop density_[^1], and _crop type_.  Per type, I have chosen to focus on corn and soybeans.\n",
    "\n",
    "[^1]: Crop density is not explicitly given in the datasets, however, the spatial density of each crop can be calculated using that crop's pixel count divided by the total pixel count of all crops in the province."

    "### Application Description\n",
    "I decided to use the crop data for 10 consecutive years (2015-2024) to **study the spatial and temporal change of the two most widely grown crops in Onrario: _corn_ and _soybean_**. I chose the Provice Ontario because it is the most agricultrally active province in Canada, and it is also interesting to me as it is where I live. Moreover, I chose corn and soybean not only becase they are widely grown, but also because our nutriotion strogly depends on them in terms of grains, sugars, and oil. "

    "### Data Transformation and Preprocessing\n",
    "1.  I downloaded the TIF files for Ontario for the 2015 to 2024 period. Each file is about 1GB, and contains the crop data for all crop times in the provice, as well as data for lands that are not used for agriculture, or where clouds made it impossible to determine the crop type. I do not need all this data, so I filtered it and made new dataframes which I later used for my analysis.\n",
    "2.  I used the `rasterio` package to read the files, and converted the coordinates to longitude and latitude. \n",
    "3.  I am interested in corn and soybean, so I filtered the data for each year to oly contain the pixels for these two crops. So, for each year, I have a dataframe with 3 colums: longitude, latitude, and crop type (corn or soybean). There was not missing data for crops (in the original data, there are pixels where it was impossible to determine crop type because of clouds, these areas have a different code and are already eliminated with the initial filtering). Also, there are no outliers, as for each pixel we have the specific crop type or we know that it is covered by clouds or was not used for agiculture at all.\n",
    "4.  I am also interested in the spatial density of these crops for each year, so I made a new dataframe that contains year, corn pixel count, soybean pixel count, and total crop pixel count. Using this dataframe, I later calculate the spatial density for each crop per year. Here, I ignored the lands that were not used for agriculture, as well as the lands covered by clouds (which could be used for agriculture, but is essentially missing data)."
